Building Pipeline:
1. Create a Github repo and clone it in local (Add experiments).
2. Add src folder along with all components(run them individuals).
3. Add data, models, reports directories to .gitignore file
4. Now git add, commit, push

Setting up dvc Pipeline without params
5. Create dvc.yaml file add stages to it.
6. dvc init then do dvc repo to test the Pipeline automation 
7. Now git add, commit, push

Setting up dvc Pipeline with params
8. Add params.yaml file
9. Add the params setup (metioned below)
10. Do "dvc repo" again to test the Pipeline along with the params
11. Now git add, commit, push

Experiments with DVC:
12. pip install dvclive
13. Add the dvclive code block (metioned below)
14. Do "dvc exp run" it will create a new dvc.yaml(if already not there) and dvclive directory (each run will be considered as an experiments by dvc)
15. Do "dvc exp show" on terminal to see the experiments or use extension in VS code (install dvc extension)
16. "dvc exp remove" to remove exp(optional) "dvc exp apply {exp-name}" to reproduce prev exp
17. Change params re-run code (produce new experiments)
18. Now git add, commit, push
